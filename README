Search Engine Construction Kit

version 0.0.1

DIRECTORY ORGANIZATION

seck-lib -- library routines that are shared by both the backend applications and the web application

seck-app -- suite of backend applications that are responsible for crawling and indexing/archiving (cataloging) data 

seck-web -- servlet-based web application providing users with a browser interface access to the search engine data

ECLIPSE GUIDE

To develop the project in eclipse (this is assuming that you've correctly pulled or forked the project from the master branch):

1. cd /path/to/seck/sec-lib
   mvn eclipse:eclipse
   from eclipse:
     File > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace > [select path to sec-lib] make sure that you do not check copy project into workspace as this will cause problems for synchronizing with GIT

2. Repeat step #1 for sec-app and sec-web

3. From eclipse configure build path for sec-app and sec-web
   Java Build Path > Projects > Add > seck-lib

The idea here is that both app and web depend on lib.

TOMCAT

Tomcat is configured to run in place within seck-web, to use it:

cd /path/to/seck-web
mvn tomcat:run

Point your web browser to http://localhost:8080/seck-web/hello
